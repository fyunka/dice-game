### GAME RULES:

- The game has ```2 players```, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ```ROUND score```
- BUT, if the player rolls a ```1```, all his ROUND score gets **lost**. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to ```'Hold'```, which means that his ROUND score gets added to his ```GLOBAL score```. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach ```100 points on GLOBAL score``` **wins the game**

#### Enjoy and Good Luck! ðŸ˜€
